# CS3310 Programming Assignment 1: Client-Server Socket Programming

**Course:** CS3310 - Operating Systems  
**Assignment:** P1 - Socket Programming  
**Student:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** August 27, 2025  
**Language:** C (ISO C99 Standard)  
**Platform:** Linux/Unix Systems

## Project Overview

This project implements a basic client-server application using TCP sockets in C. The server listens for client connections, receives text messages, transforms them to uppercase, and sends the modified text back to the client. The implementation demonstrates fundamental socket programming concepts including socket creation, binding, listening, accepting connections, and data transmission.

## Assignment Requirements

All requirements have been successfully implemented:

- **Custom Port**: Uses port **19845** (5-digit number < 65535)
- **Command Line Input**: Client accepts input via command line arguments (not prompts)
- **Data Transmission**: Client sends user input to server
- **Data Reception**: Server receives data from client
- **Data Transformation**: Server converts messages to uppercase
- **Response Handling**: Server sends transformed data back to client
- **Display Results**: Client displays server response
- **Multiple Connections**: Server handles multiple consecutive client requests
- **Server Persistence**: Server runs until explicitly terminated (Ctrl-C)
- **Client Termination**: Client processes one request and exits
- **Code Quality**: Proper commenting following Cedarville style guidelines

└── client            # Compiled client executable
```

## Compilation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler
- Linux/Unix environment
- Standard C libraries

### Build Commands

```bash
# Compile server
gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c99 -pedantic -o server server.c

# Compile client
gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c99 -pedantic -o client client.c
```

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Start the Server
```bash
./server
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Starting server on port 19845...
Server listening on port 19845. Press Ctrl-C to quit.
```

### Step 2: Run the Client

```bash
./client "Your message here"
```

**Example:**
```bash
./client "This is a message to be modified."
```

**Expected Client Output:**
```
Connecting to server at 127.0.0.1:19845...
Connected to server successfully.
Sending message: "This is a message to be modified."
Server response: "THIS IS A MESSAGE TO BE MODIFIED."
Disconnected from server.
```

**Expected Server Output:**
```
Client connected from 127.0.0.1:xxxxx
Received from client: This is a message to be modified.
Sending back transformed message: THIS IS A MESSAGE TO BE MODIFIED.
Client disconnected.
```

## Testing Examples

### Basic Functionality
```bash
./client "Hello World! Testing multiple clients."
```

### Special Characters
```bash
./client "Test123!@# with numbers and symbols."
```

### Multiple Clients
```bash
./client "First client message"
./client "Second client message"  
./client "Third client message"
```

### Error Handling
```bash
./client                                    # No arguments
./client "message" "extra argument"         # Too many arguments
```

## Implementation Details

### Server Features
- **Port Configuration**: Listens on port 19845
- **Socket Options**: Uses SO_REUSEADDR for quick restart capability
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful shutdown on SIGINT (Ctrl-C)
- **Connection Handling**: Accepts and processes multiple consecutive clients
- **Data Transformation**: Converts all received text to uppercase using `toupper()`
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking for all system calls

### Client Features
- **Command Line Interface**: Accepts message as command line argument
- **Connection Management**: Connects to localhost (127.0.0.1) on port 19845
- **Single Request Model**: Sends one message and exits after receiving response
- **Input Validation**: Checks argument count and message length
- **Error Reporting**: Clear error messages for connection failures

### Communication Protocol
1. Client establishes TCP connection to server
2. Client sends message as raw bytes
3. Server receives message and converts to uppercase
4. Server sends transformed message back to client
5. Client receives response and displays it
6. Connection closes automatically after single exchange

## Technical Specifications

- **Socket Type**: TCP (SOCK_STREAM)
- **Address Family**: AF_INET (IPv4)
- **Buffer Size**: 1024 bytes
- **Maximum Clients**: 10 concurrent connections in listen queue
- **Character Encoding**: ASCII
- **Compilation Standard**: C99 with strict warnings enabled

## Code Quality Features

- **Comprehensive Comments**: Function headers and inline documentation
- **Error Handling**: All system calls checked for return values
- **Memory Safety**: Proper buffer management and bounds checking  
- **Resource Management**: All sockets properly closed
- **Signal Safety**: Clean shutdown handling
- **Coding Standards**: Follows Cedarville University style guidelines

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Address already in use" Error:**
```bash
# Wait ~60 seconds for socket to be released
```

**"Connection refused" Error:**
- Ensure server is running before starting client
- Check that firewall allows connections on port 19845

**Compilation Warnings:**
- Minor newline warnings are cosmetic and don't affect functionality

## Assignment Submission Checklist

- Server and client source code (server.c, client.c)
- Comprehensive documentation (README.md)
- Code follows Cedarville style guidelines
- Proper header comments and inline documentation
- All functional requirements implemented
- Testing completed and verified
- Screenshot of successful execution (see below)

## Execution Screenshot

The following demonstrates successful client-server communication:

```
Terminal 1 (Server):
$ ./server
Starting server on port 19845...
Server listening on port 19845. Press Ctrl-C to quit.
Client connected from 127.0.0.1:54321
Received from client: This is a message to be modified.
Sending back transformed message: THIS IS A MESSAGE TO BE MODIFIED.
Client disconnected.

Terminal 2 (Client):
$ ./client "This is a message to be modified."
Connecting to server at 127.0.0.1:19845...
Connected to server successfully.
Sending message: "This is a message to be modified."
Server response: "THIS IS A MESSAGE TO BE MODIFIED."
Disconnected from server.
```
